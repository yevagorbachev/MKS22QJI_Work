Due **T 2020-03-17** 08:00 EST

Estimated time required: <=90min

With a new partner, whip up a Flask app to give a front-end to your mongodb querying machinery.

- Keep it simple.
- When your flask app launches, it should drop your db on your default mongo server and rebuild it.
- Use form elements and adequate explanation to facilitate querying.
- Tailor to suit your data.

*PROTIP: Test each query in a mongo shell before baking into your python code.*
